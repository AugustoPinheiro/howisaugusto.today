## Goals

**To answer questions about my life, like**

- How does living in different cities affect other factors like fitness, productivity and happiness?
- How does sleep affect my day, my fitness level, and happiness?
- How does the weather, and the different seasons affect my life?
- Are there any trends over the last few years?
- How does computer time, work and hours in meetings affect my personal life?

**Key decisions for this project:**

- Use a single database, owned and hosted by me, with all the data I've collected over the years
- Be able to [easily add and remove questions](https://github.com/KrauseFx/FxLifeSheet/blob/master/lifesheet.json) on the fly, as I learn what's beneficial to track
- Full control of how the data is visualized
- Works well for frequent flyers with mixed time zones
- 100% fully open source, MIT licensed and self-hosted
